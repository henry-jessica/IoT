## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## üíª Goal 
 * Get familiar with the Arduino Yun 
 * Get familiar with the Grove Kit
 * Setup a GitHub account, create a repository & push a commit
* Commit Arduino code to your GitHub repository


#### INTERNET OF THINGS

The Internet of Things is the network of physical objects that contain embedded technology to communicate and interact with their internal states or the external environment. Gartner predicts 20bn devices by the end of 2020 - 2017 saw the such devices outnumber humans. This represents devices, not people employing bi-directional communication resulting in large, complex data flows requiring new types of insight.

The IoT represents the fourth evolutionary stage of development for the Internet. Initially, the internet housed shared documents. Commerce followed enabling business 
(e.g. Amazon, eBay) to be transacted. More recently, people have generated increasing volumes of content (e.g. Youtube, Facebook). This includes directly contributed information but also that data captured autonomously - location, buying preferences, activity, health. The fourth evolution will represent a virtual tsunami of data as everyday objects (already, televisions, cars, phones) become intelligent and connected. These devices do not necessarily communicate with humans. Increasingly, machine learning will imbue intelligence into the behaviour of these devices prompting deeper and more extensive autonomy of action.
